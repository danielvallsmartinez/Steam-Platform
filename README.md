# Steam-Platform
Front-End and Back-End development

This project consists in a games distribution platform based on Steam, where the user is able to sign up, login, upload a profile picture, add games to cart from a list we take from an API REST, buy them with the money he/she have on the wallet and add some money manually or inviting new friends (through email) to join the platform.
The project follows the Model View Controller architecture and we did it inside a Docker environment with Nginx to run the server, Composer to manage php dependencies and libreries, Slim to create the web application, Twig to work with the view and a MySQL database to save user and game's data.

Languages used: html, css, javascript and php.
